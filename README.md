Abstract
============
This project analyses Indirect Adaptive Control. The report contains a basic theory of adaptive control and
Indirect Adaptive control. The Indirect Adaptive Control is divided into the adaptive observer and the tuner
and the controller. The design as well as stability proofs for adaptive observer are provided. The tuner and
the controller are briefly explained as they are partially covered in the adaptive observer section. 
Additionally this type of controller is simulated on a second order plant which has to follow a first order 
reference model. The results are presented for various inputs for varying parameters of plant.
